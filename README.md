#This project is to help you learn a few things

I'll assign problems to you. You will solve them and submit them for my review and advice. 

I will add a file with a problem name to the Problems directory. You will try to solve the problem. 
Once you are ready you will submit a Pull Request with your solution. 

I will then review and give you feedback.
